# Project Structure

## üìå Context and Objective

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/955e8943-b5e6-4aa4-a70c-fc4c311d5f45" alt="Waze Logo" width="200" height="200" />
</p>

This project focuses on predicting monthly user churn for Waze, a community-driven navigation app that partners with users, map editors, and organizations worldwide to improve the driving experience. It supports Waze‚Äôs broader effort to boost user growth and increase retention.

By analyzing user behavior data and building a predictive model, this project aims to:

* **Identify** which users are most likely to churn  
* **Uncover** when churn typically occurs  
* **Understand** potential reasons behind churn  

**The goal is to build a machine learning model that identifies users at risk of leaving, enabling Waze to engage them proactively with targeted retention strategies that enhance user satisfaction and drive business growth.**
