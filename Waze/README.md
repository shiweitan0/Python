This project focuses on predicting monthly user churn for Waze, a community-driven navigation app that partners with users, map editors, and organizations worldwide to improve the driving experience. It supports Wazeâ€™s broader effort to boost user growth and increase retention.

By analyzing user behavior data and building a predictive model, this project aims to:

* **Identify** which users are most likely to churn  
* **Uncover** when churn typically occurs  
* **Understand** potential reasons behind churn  

**The goal is to build a machine learning model that identifies users at risk of leaving, enabling Waze to engage them proactively with targeted retention strategies that enhance user satisfaction and drive business growth.**
