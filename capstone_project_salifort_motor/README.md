# Project Structure

## ðŸ“Œ Context and Objective

The project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving Salifort Motors, with the aim of improving employee retention, enhancing job satisfaction, and reducing turnover-related costs.

By analyzing employee survey and HR data, this project aims to:

* **Identify** which employees are most likely to leave the company (churn)
